                                        &emsp; My name is Daniel Poprawski. I just got out of the Army after 4 years of
                                        service and I am pursuing a career as a front-end web developer. I have been
                                        programming since I was a teenager when I first discovered HTML and CSS, and
                                        later Javascript, my first programming language. After playing with Javscript I
                                        moved on to Python and Java and then finally came back to Javascript after
                                        discovering React. Programming is something that I have been passionate about
                                        for as long as I remember and I would be very happy and honored to build your
                                        website for you.
                                </p>
                        </div>
                        <Footer />
                </>
        );
